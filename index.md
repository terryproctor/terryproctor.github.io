## Software Devloper

In 2020, I was forced into being placed on furlough during the lockdown due to Covid-19. 
In May, I decided I was going to make a career change and I decided to try learning to code. 
As a result I found that I enjoyed it and I was pretty good at coding too.
I'm still working my regular job whilst studying and making projects, but hopefully that'll change as well!

### What I've learnt so far:

* HTML and CSS
* Javascipt
* Python
* Some C (through CS50)
* Git
* Using Linux (terminal especially!)

I have also gained a PCEP qualification in Python programming language and I have started a Computing and IT degree with Open University.

### Projects

*Coming soon*
