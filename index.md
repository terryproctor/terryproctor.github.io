# Terry Proctor
## Software Developer

In 2020, I was forced into being placed on furlough during the lockdown due to Covid-19. 
In May, I decided I was going to make a career change and I decided to try learning to code. 
As a result I found that I enjoyed it and I was pretty good at coding too.
I'm still working my regular job whilst studying and making projects, but hopefully that'll change as well!

I'm a big fan on the Python Programming language and also web design using CSS. 
My other interests include photography and powerlifting.

### What I've learnt so far:

* HTML and CSS
* Javascipt
* Python
* Git
* SQL
* Linux (terminal especially!)

I have also gained a PCEP qualification in Python programming language and I have started a Computing and IT degree with Open University.
